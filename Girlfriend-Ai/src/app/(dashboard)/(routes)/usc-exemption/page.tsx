          We operate as a purely AI-generated content platform where no real
          individuals are portrayed or engaged in any content creation. Every
          piece of content accessible on Couple.me (the”APP”) is exclusively
          generated through artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This method
          eliminates the participation of real human beings in the creation of
          images, videos, or any other material available on our APP. The
          Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law is therefore not applicable.
          If you have any questions or require further clarification regarding
          18 U.S.C. 2257 Exemption, please contact us at: support@couple.me or
          directly report in the APP in the “Contact” section.
