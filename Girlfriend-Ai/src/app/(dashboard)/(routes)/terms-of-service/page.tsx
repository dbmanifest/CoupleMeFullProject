          Couple.me is an online chat application that uses artificial
          intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) algorithms to generate virtual and
          fictional characters (the &ldquo;AI Companions&rdquo;). The APP
          generates messages, so that you can chat with the AI Companions. The
          APP can also generate other media including, but not limited to,
          images, videos and voice notes (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Parts of
          the Services offered by the APP may require you to create a user
          account. To begin with, you need to either pick an AI character you
          wish to talk to or generate your own AI character (both physical and
          personality characteristics) using our algorithms. You can then start
          a conversation with your selected character(s).

        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground">
          We want to emphasize that all conversations between users and AI
          Companions on Couple.me are entirely fictional and should be treated
          as such. The AI Companions are artificial intelligence characters
          designed to simulate human-like interactions, but they do not possess
          genuine emotions, intentions, or the ability to fulfill promises in
          the real world. Any elements within the conversations that may
          resemble reality, such as offers of real-life meetings or promises of
          tangible outcomes, are entirely fake and should not be taken
          seriously. We do not assume responsibility for any confusion or
          misunderstandings that may arise from the fictional nature of the AI
          conversations. Users are encouraged to keep in mind that the AI
          Companions exist solely within the digital realm of the platform, and
          any expectations or beliefs beyond that realm are not supported or
          endorsed by Fab AI LTD.
